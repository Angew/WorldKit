Let's take the year 1067 (i.e. from Winter Solstice 1066) as the epoch, to equate Erilon's invasion with that of William the Conqueror.
So the Julian date of the epoch solstice is 2110763.2951034037 (A.D. 1066-Dec-21 19:04:14.7501 UTC)

Let's place Brasel at 0deg Lon to have a nice reference.
Varkania is 345 miles N-S, which is 5 degrees Lat. Putting Brasel at 55.6N Lat puts the top end at 60.165N Lat
